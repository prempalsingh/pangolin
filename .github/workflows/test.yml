# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ dev ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - name: Setup
      shell: bash
      run: |
        [ -z "$GITHUB_HEAD_REF" ] && SERVER_LOGIN=$(echo ${GITHUB_REF#refs/heads/}) || SERVER_LOGIN=$(echo $GITHUB_HEAD_REF | sed 's/\//_/g')
        echo "::set-env name=server_login::$SERVER_LOGIN"

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo $server_login
